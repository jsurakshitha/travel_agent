# AI-Powered Travel Planner Agent ‚úàÔ∏è

## Problem Statement

Travel planning is often a **complex, time-consuming, and inefficient** process. Users spend hours navigating multiple websites to find destinations, compare prices for flights and hotels, and piece together itineraries. This fragmented approach leads to frustration and missed opportunities for a truly personalized and seamless travel experience.

## Proposed Solution

Our solution is an **AI-powered Travel Planner Agent** designed to transform complex travel planning into a seamless and enjoyable process. This intelligent assistant leverages generative AI and real-time data to create **personalized and optimized travel plans** tailored to individual user preferences, budgets, and constraints.

## Key Features ‚ú®

* **Personalized Itinerary Generation**: Crafts custom multi-day travel itineraries based on user input, including destinations, dates, budget, interests (e.g., family-friendly, adventurous), and specific preferences.
* **Real-time Data Integration**: Fetches live data from various APIs for current weather conditions, flight availability, hotel prices, and local events to provide up-to-date and accurate recommendations.
* **Intelligent Recommendations**: Suggests optimal destinations, accommodation options, transportation routes, and local guides, ensuring a smooth and relevant travel experience.
* **Seamless Booking Management**: (Conceptual) Provides a framework to integrate with booking platforms, managing reservations and alerting users to any changes or delays.
* **On-the-Go Optimization**: (Conceptual) Adapts itineraries dynamically to account for real-time changes in conditions (e.g., flight delays, sudden weather shifts) or user feedback during the trip.

## Technology Stack üõ†Ô∏è

* **Core AI**:
    * **IBM Granite Model**: Utilized as the primary large language model for understanding natural language queries, generating coherent itineraries, and providing contextual information.
    * **IBM Cloud Lite Services**: The foundational cloud platform for hosting and managing the AI agent. This includes:
        * **IBM Cloud Watsonx AI Studio**: For developing and testing the AI models.
        * **IBM Cloud Watsonx AI Runtime**: For deploying and serving the Granite model for inference.
        * **IBM Cloud Agent Lab**: (Conceptual) For orchestrating the agent's various components and tools.
* **Programming Language**: Python
* **Frameworks & Libraries**:
    * **LangChain / IBM Agent Lab Orchestration**: (Conceptual) For building the conversational flow, integrating external tools (APIs), and connecting to the IBM Granite model.
    * **External APIs**: For real-time data fetching (e.g., Google Maps API, weather APIs, flight/hotel booking APIs).
    * **Streamlit / Flask**: (Optional - for building a simple web UI) For creating an interactive front-end for the agent.

## Conceptual Code Snippet (Illustrative Example)

This conceptual Python code demonstrates the core logic of how the agent would orchestrate an API call to fetch real-time data and then use the IBM Granite model (simulated here) to generate a personalized itinerary. **This code is for illustrative purposes to show architectural understanding and is not runnable without a full project implementation and actual IBM Watsonx AI API setup.**

```python
# This is a conceptual example and won't run without proper API keys,
# IBM Watsonx AI setup, and a robust data retrieval system.

import os
# In a real project, you would import actual IBM Watsonx AI client libraries
# from ibm_watsonx_ai.ml_api_v1 import APIClient
# from ibm_watsonx_ai.enums import ModelTypes
# from ibm_watsonx_ai.completion import Completion

        # In a real scenario, this would initialize the actual IBM Watsonx AI client
        print("Initialized conceptual IBM Granite Client.")

    def generate_itinerary(self, prompt, max_tokens=500):
